* **Function pointers** *-  are variables that can store the memory address of functions and can be used in a program to create a function call to functions pointed by them. Also called a subroutine pointer or procedure pointer, is a pointer that points to a function. As opposed to referencing a data value, a function pointer points to executable code within memory.*
