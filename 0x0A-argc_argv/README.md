# C - argc, argv # 
------
* **argc and argv** *- are how command line arguments are passed to main() in C.*
* **argc (argument cout)** *- is the number of strings pointed to by argv.*
* **argv (argument vector)** *- is the strings pointed to by argv.*

------

### General Objectives ###
 * How to use arguments passed to your program
 * What are two prototypes of *main* that you know of, and in which case do you use one or the other
 * How to use *__attribute__((unused))* or *(void)* to compile functions with unused variables or parameters.

------

0 - Write a program that prints its name, followed by a new line.
 * If you rename the program, it will print the new name, without having to compile it again
 * You should not remove the path before the name of the program

1 - Write a program that prints the number of arguments passed into it.
 * Your program should print a number, followed by a new line

2 - Write a program that prints all arguments it receives.
 * All arguments should be printed, including the first one
 * Only print one argument per line, ending with a new line

3 - Write a program that multiplies two numbers.
 * Your program should print the result of the multiplication, followed by a new line
 * You can assume that the two numbers and result of the multiplication can be stored in an integer
 * If the program does not receive two arguments, your program should print Error, followed by a new line, and return 1

4 - Write a program that multiplies two numbers.
 * Your program should print the result of the multiplication, followed by a new line
 * You can assume that the two numbers and result of the multiplication can be stored in an integer
 * If the program does not receive two arguments, your program should print Error, followed by a new line, and return 1
